# EXTERMINATION

https://www.newgrounds.com/projects/games/1728642/preview/filetype/2

There used to be a password. I gave up on the password thing. This has always been open source and you could just compile it from said source, so there's your build. Follow that newgrounds link. It'll get updated kinda frequently whenever there's a breakthrough or something.

This game is really coming together now! It's still a long way from being finished, but it's also come a very long way from just being a jumpy square in a big room. There's bad guys and guns and ammo and breakable boxes and everything now.

## COMPILING:

You will need an AppID from Newgrounds.com, saved to a file with no extension called ``appId`` in the root directory of the project. The target you want is lime HTML5.

## DEPENDENCIES:
```
haxelib install flixel-addons
haxelib install flixel-ui
haxelib install newgrounds
```
