The following is a bunch of questions I asked myself, and have now answered. The internet is down and I don't fancy programming right now, so have a few hundred lines of lore instead of 6 lines of code.

# Who's that batman-looking guy and why's he killing people?
Badman is a super-hero gone bad. Fed up with the police's lack of intervention on crime and relying too heavily on his heroic acts - as well as the people's pessimism, indifference and lack of respect - he has gone completely off the rails and has decided to kill everyone he sees, innocent or otherwise.

# Setting
Badman prowls and "protects" the streets of Goresville, in the fictional country of Anarchia. A new country, less than 50 years old, it was discovered off the coast of Australia and bought by an eccentric billionaire as a giant social experiment. In its early days, there were no laws. If you had no ties to your country of origin's government, anyone from anywhere could immigrate. Crimes were not defined, and people were allowed to do as they pleased. This meant that thieves, rapists and murderers had only the social repurcussions to fear for their actions.

A majority of the citizens of Anarchia are people from all around the world seeking to escape their country's laws. This means that in the streets of Goresville, you will find stores that openly sell drugs such as heroin, marijuana and cocaine without fear of prosecution. Other services, amongst the usual food joints and convenience stores, will offer mercenaries and assassins, or hackers.

Governments from outside Anarchia would frequently attempt to make deals or communicate, every attempt of which was ignored. When threatened with invasion, such claims mysteriously went quiet and action was not taken. Before long it became evident to everyone that Anarchia was untouchable. The outside world stopped covering it on the news. It came up less and less frequently in political discussion. With no undersea cables, broadband internet was not established, and satellite internet was rare. 

An intra-net was naturally established. While technically possible to create a tunnel via satellite internet, it was assumed the outside world had no access to it. Downloads from the internet such as literature, media and pornography were considered valuable and sold like commodities, if such content was not produced locally.

# How do you govern anarchy?
Almost as soon as the country was founded, the government of the country was put into place. However, this government existed to ensure that the image of Anarchia be preserved through its growth and development.

Anarchia was to be a country where crime was not a word. Fear of your state was to be non-existent. Should any group of people, or singular person try to claim power or control over resources, the police would intervene and shut it down. You would not need to call them. They would come.

Should the police witness any acts of violence occur in public, they had no obligations to intervene. Very often, there would be undercover police informants installed in groups, gangs and companies. If such a discovery was made, little to nothing was done about it as they posed little threat. The police would not intervene with criminal activities, and they received their fundings from elsewhere, so they were not concerned about tax evasion. They were there only to look for threats to the government and to extinguish the flame of rebellion. If an informant however was thrown out or harmed, or if they stopped reporting to the police altogether, this would be seen as an attack against the government, and the organisation would be quickly "dealt with".

# The Iron Man
With his identity a secret, the founder of Anarchia used his seemingly unending wealth to purchase technology from all around the world, and became the strongest military force in the country. He went only by the name "Tech", and was considered to be somewhat of a hero.

With no laws, the moral line was often blurred - on occasion, his actions would upset more people than it pleased. However, for the most part he acted to protect people from harm and to help his country prosper.

After he had established himself as the primary hand of law in Anarchia, as well as the kingpin of all business in the country, Tech kept a hands-off approach to diplomacy with other countries. He understood that imports would be necessary to feed the population and build houses, but wanted nothing to do with the politics of running a country. Trade deals were rarely agreed upon. Most of the time, in order to combat famine and keep the population of Anarchia from dwindling, he would purchase food in bulk and distribute it amongst the poorest citizens. Despite these acts of charity, there was little to no governance and the citizens had to fend for themselves.

Even before he founded the country, Tech's true identity was kept a closely guarded secret. Some would theorise that he had ties to the illuminati. Others would assume he was the CEO of a tech giant. As much speculation as there was, the fact became clear that Tech was not your average human being. He had access to some sort of power power that not only made him a super-man, but protected Anarchia from the grips of the outside world.

Tech showed his face to one woman, who he had a child with - and quickly assassinated her as soon as his son was born to prevent his identity from being revealed.

That child was Badman.

# 20 years later
Anarchia has developed into a country surrounded by wealth, but stricken with poverty. Enormous walls line the shores, allowing for fishing and sailing, but preventing ships from leaving or entering the country from outside. Aircraft usage is allowed only to officially trained pilots, for government business. What was once an image of freedom, has become the definition of a prison.

Tech, with his age increasing and his physical abilities decreasing, has retreated into a giant fortress in the middle of the country, where he maintains control and tries to enforce peace through police and governance. This fortress is considered to be the new capitol city.

Without his presence, Goresville has become run-down in most areas. Murders and attacks are becoming more and more frequent, and Tech's control over the country is starting to wane. More and more, as groups attempt to claim dominance over resources, the police's attempts to squash the rebellion are becoming noticeably weaker.

Badman, having lived a lifetime surrounded by wealth and in safety from the outside world, has had the mantle of the hero thrust onto him as a result of his fathers retirement. Being forced into a role he did not ask for, he does his best to manage the already increasingly dangerous levels of violence in Goresville.

During an incident where he was infiltrating a gang of human traffickers, he discovered a government database leak that wasn't otherwise released to the public or known about. From this database, he learns that his mother did not actually die during childbirth as he had been lead to believe, but rather killed so that his father could continue playing the hero. 

This pushes him over the edge, and Badman sees the whole country as the enemy and seeks to tear down the walls and destroy everything that has been built. 

Starting with the Goresville police department, Badman works his way through the country towards the capital fortress to confront his father and make him watch as he destroys everything.
